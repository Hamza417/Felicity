This is the initial public alpha release of Felicity. The primary focus of this build
is core playback stability and performance. The foundational audio engine is ready for
daily use, but several secondary features and interface elements remain incomplete.

### Features

- Real-time library updates, the app will automatically detect and incorporate new media files in real-time without needing to restart/refresh.
- Basic playback controls (play, pause, stop, next, previous) are fully functional and responsive.
- The audio engine has two decoders FFmpeg and System Decoder both are supported and fully working.
- Hi-res (tested upto 24-bit, 32 is expected to work as well), Gapless and Skip Silence is supported and working.
- App has zero latency performance and expected to load and work instantly on all supported platforms.
- Built in artflow for songs.
- Currently, Songs, Albums, Artists, Genres and Folders are supported as library categories, with more to be added in future updates.
- Themes, fonts, and other UI customizations are supported and working.
- Predictive back is fully supported.

### Known Issues

- UI gaps are present in most of the areas, and many interface elements are placeholders or incomplete.
- Some features like playlists, advanced library management, and certain settings are not yet implemented.
- Edge to edge is working but navigation bar is not supported in all devices as of now.
- Scroll state loss in some horizontal lists.

### Plans (atleast for next release)

- Full implementation of playlists, including creation, editing, and management features.
- Add selections framework to the library for easier multi-item management.
- Implement more placeholders and complete the UI for most of the sections in the app.
- Queue management features.

This release is intended for early adopters and testers and any user who wants to experience the app early. Please
open as many issues as you can and any ideas are most welcome :)
