# Felicity

*_Felicity_ is the third and final app of the three project I planned for my own learning, the first
two are [Positional](https://github.com/Hamza417/Positional)
and [Inure App Manager](https://github.com/Hamza417/Inure).*

The development of the app has started and if you've used the first two apps you might wanna join
the [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/felicity_music_player) and become the part of the whole initial
development process.

I am taking my time developing it because I want it to exceed my own expectations and by that I mean the quality of the software. I hope you are patient enough until the first few results :)

## Update

10 Jan 2025: I have managed to make the file processing insanely fast and solved the file reading issues that I was facing. Here is the final log of the file processing:
