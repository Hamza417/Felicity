# Felicity

*_Felicity_ is the third and final app of the three project I planned for my own learning, the first
two are [Positional](https://github.com/Hamza417/Positional)
and [Inure App Manager](https://github.com/Hamza417/Inure).*

The development of the app has started and if you've used the first two apps you might wanna join
the [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/felicity_music_player) and become the part of the whole initial
development process.

**(1 April, 2024)** Didn't work :D

**(31 March, 2024)** I'm finalizing the loader soon. I'm yet to be sure whether to use MediaStore
APIs or
simply use the direct storage to unify the whole apps data structure. Using MediaStore doesn't seem
to be
allowing complex UI manuevers, so I might stick to the direct storage.
